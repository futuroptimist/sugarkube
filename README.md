An accessible [k3s](https://k3s.io/) platform for Raspberry Pis and SBCs,
integrated with an off-grid solar setup.
The repository also covers the solar cube art installation, which powers aquarium air pumps and
small computers. It doubles as a living trellis‚Äîclimbing plants weave through the aluminium
extrusions, while shade-loving herbs thrive beneath the panels. Hanging baskets can clip onto the
frame so the installation is surrounded by greenery.

### What's in a name?

"Sugarkube" refers to both the aluminium cube covered in solar panels **and**
the helper scripts that provide "syntactic sugar" for Kubernetes. Throughout
the docs you will see the term used in both contexts.

## Repository layout

- `cad/` ‚Äî OpenSCAD models of structural parts. See
  [docs/pi_cluster_carrier.md](docs/pi_cluster_carrier.md) for the Pi carrier plate,
  [cad/solar_cube/panel_bracket.scad](cad/solar_cube/panel_bracket.scad) for the solar
  panel bracket with an `edge_radius` parameter (default 4‚Äâmm) to round its outer edges,
  and [cad/solar_cube/frame.scad](cad/solar_cube/frame.scad) for a parametric 2020 cube frame.
- `elex/` ‚Äî KiCad and Fritzing electronics schematics including the `power_ring`
  board (see [elex/power_ring/specs.md](elex/power_ring/specs.md) and
  [docs/electronics_schematics.md](docs/electronics_schematics.md))
- `hardware/` ‚Äî accessories like the Mac mini keyboard station cap (see
  [docs/mac_mini_station.md](docs/mac_mini_station.md))
- `docs/` ‚Äî build instructions, safety notes, and learning resources
- [docs/solar_basics.md](docs/solar_basics.md) ‚Äî introduction to how solar panels generate
  power
- [docs/electronics_basics.md](docs/electronics_basics.md) ‚Äî essential circuits and tools
- [docs/power_system_design.md](docs/power_system_design.md) ‚Äî sizing batteries and
  charge controllers
- [docs/insert_basics.md](docs/insert_basics.md) ‚Äî guide for heat-set inserts and printed threads
- [docs/network_setup.md](docs/network_setup.md) ‚Äî connect the Pi cluster to your network
- [docs/lcd_mount.md](docs/lcd_mount.md) ‚Äî optional 1602 LCD standoff locations
- [docs/pi_headless_provisioning.md](docs/pi_headless_provisioning.md) ‚Äî headless boot playbook covering
  `secrets.env` usage
- [docs/templates/cloud-init/user-data.example](docs/templates/cloud-init/user-data.example) ‚Äî cloud-init
  template for SSH keys and `Wi-Fi` credentials
- `scripts/` ‚Äî helper scripts for rendering and exports
  - `download_pi_image.sh` ‚Äî fetch the latest Pi image via the GitHub CLI; supports `--dry-run`
    metadata checks and uses POSIX `test -ef` instead of `realpath` for better macOS
    compatibility
  - `install_sugarkube_image.sh` ‚Äî install the GitHub CLI when missing, download the
    latest release, verify checksums, expand the `.img.xz`, and emit a new
    `.img.sha256`; safe to run via `curl | bash`
  - `collect_pi_image.sh` ‚Äî normalize pi-gen output into a single `.img.xz`,
    clean up temporary work directories, use POSIX `test -ef` to compare paths
    without `realpath`, and fall back to `unzip` when `bsdtar` is unavailable
  - `build_pi_image.sh` ‚Äî build a Raspberry Pi OS image with cloud-init and
    k3s preinstalled; embeds `pi_node_verifier.sh` and clones `token.place` and
    `democratizedspace/dspace` by default. Customize branches with
    `TOKEN_PLACE_BRANCH` (default `main`) and `DSPACE_BRANCH` (default `v3`). Set
    `CLONE_SUGARKUBE=true` to include this repo and pass space-separated Git URLs
    via `EXTRA_REPOS` to clone additional projects; needs a valid `user-data.yaml`
    and ~10 GB free disk space. Set `DEBUG=1` to trace script execution.
  - `flash_pi_media.sh` ‚Äî stream `.img` or `.img.xz` directly to removable
    media with SHA-256 verification and automatic eject. A PowerShell wrapper
    (`flash_pi_media.ps1`) shells out to the same Python core on Windows.
  - `flash_and_report.py` ‚Äî wrap flashing with automatic decompression,
    checksum verification, hardware introspection, and Markdown/HTML/JSON
    reports. Pair with the headless provisioning guide for unattended boots.
  - `pi_node_verifier.sh` ‚Äî check k3s prerequisites; use `--json` for machine output or
    `--help` for usage
  - `scan-secrets.py` ‚Äî scan diffs for high-risk patterns using `ripsecrets` when
    available and also run a regex check to catch common tokens
- `outages/` ‚Äî structured outage records (see
  [docs/outage_catalog.md](docs/outage_catalog.md))
- `tests/` ‚Äî quick checks for helper scripts and documentation

## Pi image releases

The `pi-image-release` workflow builds a fresh Raspberry Pi OS image on every
push to `main` and once per day. Each run publishes a signed
`sugarkube.img.xz`, its checksum, a provenance manifest, and the full
`pi-gen` build log. Release notes summarize stage timings and link directly to
the manifest so you can verify the build inputs and commit hashes before
flashing. Run `./scripts/install_sugarkube_image.sh` (or fetch the same helper
via `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/futuroptimist/sugarkube/main/scripts/install_sugarkube_image.sh | bash`) to
download, verify, and expand the latest release, or run `make flash-pi
FLASH_DEVICE=/dev/sdX` to chain download ‚Üí verification ‚Üí flashing with the new
streaming helper. `./scripts/sugarkube-latest` remains available when you only
need the `.img.xz` artifact with checksum verification.

Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing.
This triggers `scripts/checks.sh`, which installs required tooling and runs
linters, tests, and documentation checks.

New to sugarkube? Start with [`docs/pi_imager_presets/`](docs/pi_imager_presets/)
for Raspberry Pi Imager presets and
[`docs/pi_headless_provisioning.md`](docs/pi_headless_provisioning.md) for a
secret-friendly, headless provisioning walkthrough backed by the flashing
report generator.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/futuroptimist/sugarkube.git
# or with SSH:
# git clone git@github.com:futuroptimist/sugarkube.git
cd sugarkube
pip install pre-commit pyspelling linkchecker
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

If you update documentation, install `aspell` and verify spelling and links.
`pyspelling` relies on `aspell` and an English dictionary (`aspell-en`). The
`scripts/checks.sh` helper tries to install them via `apt-get` when missing. Pre-commit
runs these checks and fails if spelling or links are broken:

```bash
sudo apt-get install aspell aspell-en  # Debian/Ubuntu
brew install aspell                    # macOS
pyspelling -c .spellcheck.yaml
linkchecker --no-warnings README.md docs/
```

The `--no-warnings` flag prevents linkchecker from returning a non-zero exit
code on benign Markdown parsing warnings.

Scan staged changes for secrets before committing:

```bash
git diff --cached | ./scripts/scan-secrets.py
```

If the repository includes a `package.json` but `npm` or `package-lock.json`
are missing, `scripts/checks.sh` will warn and skip JavaScript-specific
checks.

STL files are produced automatically by CI for each OpenSCAD model and can be
downloaded from the workflow run. Provide a single `.scad` file path to render a
variant locally. The script accepts only one argument and prints a usage
message if others are supplied:

```bash
bash scripts/openscad_render.sh cad/pi_cluster/pi5_triple_carrier_rot45.scad
STANDOFF_MODE=printed bash scripts/openscad_render.sh cad/pi_cluster/pi5_triple_carrier_rot45.scad
STANDOFF_MODE=nut bash scripts/openscad_render.sh cad/pi_cluster/pi5_triple_carrier_rot45.scad
```

By default the script uses the model's `standoff_mode` value (`heatset`).
Set `STANDOFF_MODE=printed` to generate 3D-printed threads or `STANDOFF_MODE=nut` for a
captive hex recess. Values are case-insensitive and ignore surrounding whitespace;
`heatset`, `printed`, and `nut` are accepted. Supplying only whitespace uses the model's
default `standoff_mode`.

The helper script validates that the provided `.scad` file exists and that
OpenSCAD is available in `PATH`, printing a helpful error if either check fails.
It separates options from the file path with `--` and handles filenames
that begin with a dash, whether absolute or relative.
The `.scad` extension is matched case-insensitively without Bash 4 features, so
`MODEL.SCAD` works even on macOS default Bash 3.2.
