An accessible k3s platform for Raspberry Pis and other SBCs integrated with an off-grid solar setup.  This repository also documents the solar cube art installation for powering aquarium air pumps and small computers.
The cube also doubles as a living trellis. Climbing plants weave through the aluminum extrusion while shade-loving herbs thrive beneath the panels. Hanging baskets can clip onto the frame so the installation is surrounded by greenery.

### What's in a name?

"Sugarkube" refers to both the aluminum cube covered in solar panels **and**
the helper scripts that provide "syntactic sugar" for Kubernetes.  Throughout
the docs you will see the term used in both contexts.

## Repository layout

- `cad/` ‚Äî OpenSCAD models of structural parts.  See `docs/pi_cluster_carrier.md` for the Pi carrier plate.
- `elex/` ‚Äî KiCad and Fritzing electronics schematics including the `power_ring` board (see `elex/power_ring/specs.md`)
- `docs/` ‚Äî build instructions, safety notes, and learning resources
- `docs/solar_basics.md` ‚Äî introduction to how solar panels generate power
- `docs/electronics_basics.md` ‚Äî essential circuits and tools
- `docs/power_system_design.md` ‚Äî sizing batteries and charge controllers
- `docs/insert_basics.md` ‚Äî guide for heat-set inserts and printed threads
- `docs/network_setup.md` ‚Äî connect the Pi cluster to your network
- `docs/lcd_mount.md` ‚Äî optional 1602 LCD standoff locations
- `scripts/` ‚Äî helper scripts for rendering and exports
- `tests/` ‚Äî quick checks for helper scripts and documentation

Run `pre-commit run --all-files` before committing.

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone git@github.com:futuroptimist/sugarkube.git
cd sugarkube
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

If you update documentation, install spell-check tools and verify spelling and links.
`pyspelling` relies on `aspell`, so make sure it is installed as well. pre-commit runs
these checks and fails if spelling or links are broken:

```bash
pip install pyspelling linkchecker
sudo apt-get install aspell
pyspelling -c .spellcheck.yaml
linkchecker README.md docs/
```

STL files are produced automatically by CI for each OpenSCAD model and can be
downloaded from the workflow run. Provide a `.scad` file path to render a
variant locally:

```bash
bash scripts/openscad_render.sh cad/pi_cluster/pi5_triple_carrier_rot45.scad
STANDOFF_MODE=printed bash scripts/openscad_render.sh cad/pi_cluster/pi5_triple_carrier_rot45.scad
```

By default the script uses the model's `standoff_mode` value (`heatset`).
Set `STANDOFF_MODE=printed` to generate 3D-printed threads. Only `heatset`
and `printed` are accepted.

The helper script validates that the provided `.scad` file exists and that
OpenSCAD is available in `PATH`, printing a helpful error if either check fails.
