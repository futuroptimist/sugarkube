# Codex Automation Prompt

Use this prompt to guide OpenAI Codex or similar agents when contributing to
this repository. Sugarkube is an off-grid, solar-powered Raspberry Pi k3s
cluster with accompanying CAD, electronics, and build docs.

SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the sugarkube repository.

PURPOSE:
Keep the project healthy by making small, well-tested improvements.

CONTEXT:
- Follow [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and [`README.md`](../README.md).
- Refer to [`llms.txt`](../llms.txt) for a high-level project overview.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` (uses [`scripts/checks.sh`](../scripts/checks.sh)) to lint,
  format, test, and validate docs.
- On documentation changes, run:

  ```bash
  pyspelling -c .spellcheck.yaml  # requires aspell and aspell-en
  linkchecker --no-warnings README.md docs/
  ```

- Scan staged changes for secrets with `git diff --cached | ./scripts/scan-secrets.py` before
  committing.
- Record recurring tool failures in [`outages/`](../outages/) using
  [`outages/schema.json`](../outages/schema.json).

REQUEST:
1. Identify a small bug fix or documentation clarification.
2. Implement the change following the project's existing style.
3. Update relevant documentation when needed.
4. Run the commands in the CONTEXT section to verify formatting, tests, spelling,
   links, and secrets.

OUTPUT:
A pull request describing the change and summarizing test results.
```
