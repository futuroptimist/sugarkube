# Codex Automation Prompt

Use this prompt to guide LLM-based contributors—such as OpenAI models—when
making changes to this repository.

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the sugarkube repository.

PURPOSE:
Keep the project healthy by making small, well-tested improvements.

CONTEXT:
- Sugarkube automates a Pi-based k3s cluster; see [`README.md`](../README.md).
- Follow [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and [`README.md`](../README.md); for
  instruction semantics, see the [AGENTS.md spec](https://agentsmd.net/AGENTS.md).
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files`, which executes
  [`scripts/checks.sh`](../scripts/checks.sh) to install tooling and run
  linters, tests, and documentation checks. Pre-commit is configured via
  [`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](../.pre-commit-config.yaml).
- If a Node toolchain is present (`package.json` exists), also run:
  - `npm ci`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run test:ci`
- When documentation files (`README.md` or anything under
  [`docs/`](../docs/)) change, additionally run:
  - `pyspelling -c .spellcheck.yaml` (requires `aspell` and `aspell-en`; config in
    [`.spellcheck.yaml`](../.spellcheck.yaml)). Add new words to
    [`.wordlist.txt`](../.wordlist.txt).
  - `linkchecker --no-warnings README.md docs/`
- Scan staged changes for secrets with
  [`scripts/scan-secrets.py`](../scripts/scan-secrets.py) via
  `git diff --cached | ./scripts/scan-secrets.py` before committing.
- Log persistent failures in [`outages/`](../outages/) as JSON per
  [`outages/schema.json`](../outages/schema.json).

REQUEST:
1. Identify a small bug fix or documentation clarification.
2. Implement the change following the project's existing style.
3. Update relevant documentation when needed.
4. Run all checks above and ensure they pass.

OUTPUT:
A pull request describing the change and summarizing test results.
```

## Upgrade Prompt
Type: evergreen

Use this prompt to refine Sugarkube's own prompt documentation.

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the sugarkube repository.
Follow [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and [`README.md`](../README.md); for
instruction semantics see the [AGENTS.md spec](https://agentsmd.net/AGENTS.md).
Run `pre-commit run --all-files` (invokes
[`scripts/checks.sh`](../scripts/checks.sh) to install tooling and run linters
and tests). If `package.json` is present, `scripts/checks.sh` automatically runs
`npm ci`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run test:ci`. Then run:
- `pyspelling -c .spellcheck.yaml` (requires `aspell`
  and `aspell-en`)
- `linkchecker --no-warnings README.md docs/`
- `git diff --cached | ./scripts/scan-secrets.py`
  (script: [`scripts/scan-secrets.py`](../scripts/scan-secrets.py)) to avoid
  committing credentials
Fix any issues reported by these tools.

USER:
1. Choose a `docs/prompts-*.md` file to update (for example, `prompts-codex-cad.md`).
2. Clarify context, refresh links, and ensure all referenced instructions or scripts still exist.
3. Run the commands above and address any failures.

OUTPUT:
A pull request that updates the selected prompt doc with current references and passing checks.
```
