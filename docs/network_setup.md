# Network Setup

This guide explains how to connect your Pi cluster to a home network.
It assumes you are using Raspberry Pi 5 boards in a small k3s setup.

## Preconfigure WiFi

1. Download and launch [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
2. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to open **advanced options**.
3. Enter your WiFi **SSID** and **password**, enable **SSH**, and set a unique
   hostname and user for each Pi.
4. Set the wireless LAN **country** to match your location so WiFi channels are enabled correctly.
5. Write the image to an SD card or M.2 drive and repeat for the other boards.
6. Boot each Pi once to confirm it connects. From another machine run
   `ping <hostname>.local` and then `ssh <user>@<hostname>.local` to change the
   default password with `passwd`. If mDNS fails, use the IP shown on your
   router's client list.

## Switch and PoE

A gigabit Ethernet switch keeps the cluster stable. If the switch offers
PoE+ (802.3at) you can power the Pis with PoE HATs; otherwise use USBâ€‘C supplies.

## Join the cluster

Boot the control-plane Pi first. Once it appears on your router's client list,
update the OS and install `k3s` on that node as root:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade -y
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -

# Wait for the service to report Ready
sudo kubectl get nodes
```

Display the worker join token:

```sh
sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
```

Keep this token handy; it's stored at
`/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token` if you need it later.

Boot the remaining Pis and join them as workers once they can ping the
control-plane node. Use the token printed on the server (also stored at
`/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token`) and run the installer as root:

```sh
curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | K3S_URL=https://<server-ip>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<node-token> sh -
```

Verify the cluster:

```sh
sudo kubectl get nodes
```

## Manage from a workstation

To run `kubectl` from your laptop, ensure the
[kubectl client is installed](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl).
Copy the kubeconfig generated on the control-plane node, update its
server address, and verify access:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.kube
scp <user>@<server-ip>:/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml ~/.kube/config
sed -i "s/127.0.0.1/<server-ip>/g" ~/.kube/config
chmod 600 ~/.kube/config
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
kubectl get nodes
```

The `sed` command swaps the default localhost address for the control-plane
IP, and `kubectl get nodes` confirms your workstation can reach the cluster.

See the deployment guide at
[token.place](https://github.com/futuroptimist/token.place) for a detailed
walkthrough. For more options consult the
[k3s quick start](https://docs.k3s.io/quick-start) guide.
