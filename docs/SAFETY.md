# Safety

This setup uses a 12V LiFePO4 battery and outdoor wiring.  Follow these precautions:

- Place a 60A fuse within 7 inches of the battery positive terminal.
- Keep the Victron MPPT charge controller in a ventilated enclosure, never sealed inside the battery box.
- Fuse the air pump branch at 15A and the Raspberry Pi buck converter at 5A.
- Route cables so water cannot drip onto connectors; use cable glands and strain relief.
- Wear eye protection while crimping and avoid short circuits when working on the battery.
