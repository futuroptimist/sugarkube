# Testing Infrastructure

Sugarkube uses a comprehensive testing strategy combining unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end validation to ensure reliability across the Pi cluster deployment pipeline.

## Test Frameworks

### Unit Tests

**Python Tests**: Located in `tests/` with `*_test.py` naming convention
- Run with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/)
- Coverage reporting enabled via `--cov` flag
- Focus on individual component behavior and edge cases

**Shell Tests**: Located in `tests/bats/` with `*.bats` naming convention
- Run with [Bats](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/)
- Test shell script logic and command-line interfaces
- Validate parsing, error handling, and state transitions

### Integration Tests

**mDNS Roundtrip**: Located in `tests/integration/mdns_roundtrip.bats`
- Requires `AVAHI_AVAILABLE=1` environment variable
- Tests actual Avahi service publishing and discovery
- Validates the complete mDNS discovery flow

**Pi Smoke Tests**: Located in `tests/pi_smoke_test_unit_test.py`
- SSH-based validation of Pi node health
- Tests cluster readiness and service availability
- Supports reboot validation and JSON output

## Running Tests

### Quick Iteration

```bash
# Run all Python unit tests
pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_mdns_parsing.py

# Run Bats shell tests
bats tests/bats/discover_flow.bats

# Run integration tests (requires Avahi)
AVAHI_AVAILABLE=1 bats tests/integration/mdns_roundtrip.bats
```

### Full Test Suite

```bash
# Run complete test suite with linting
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This command executes `scripts/checks.sh` which:
- Installs missing tools (including `bats`)
- Runs ShellCheck on all shell scripts
- Executes both Python and Bats test suites
- Generates coverage reports

### CI Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs:
- Python tests with coverage reporting
- Uploads coverage to Codecov (when token available)
- Fails fast on first test failure (`--maxfail=1`)

## Test Coverage Requirements

- **100% patch coverage** on first test run for new features
- Design fixes to avoid reruns and minimize regression risk
- Record persistent test issues in `outages/` using `schema.json`

## Test Categories

### Discovery Flow Tests
- `tests/bats/discover_flow.bats`: Core discovery logic
- `tests/test_mdns_discovery_parsing.py`: mDNS parsing edge cases
- `tests/test_k3s_discover_token_resolution_cli.py`: Token handling

### Pi Image Tests
- `tests/build_pi_image_test.py`: Image building pipeline
- `tests/pi_smoke_test_unit_test.py`: Node health validation
- `tests/test_qemu_pi_smoke_test.py`: QEMU-based testing

### Documentation Tests
- `tests/test_doc_*.py`: Documentation validation
- `tests/test_tutorial_*.py`: Tutorial completeness
- Spellcheck and link validation via `pyspelling` and `linkchecker`

### Security Tests
- `tests/scan_secrets_test.py`: Secret detection
- `tests/test_sendemail_validate_hook.py`: Email workflow validation

## Debugging Test Failures

### Environment Issues
- Ensure required tools are installed (`bats`, `avahi-utils`, `shellcheck`)
- Check environment variables (`AVAHI_AVAILABLE`, `LOG_LEVEL`)
- Verify network connectivity for integration tests

### Test-Specific Debugging
- Use `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for verbose discovery test output
- Enable `SUGARKUBE_DEBUG_MDNS=1` for mDNS troubleshooting
- Check `outages/` directory for known issues and resolutions

### Coverage Analysis
- Review coverage reports to identify untested code paths
- Focus on critical discovery and bootstrap logic
- Ensure error handling and edge cases are covered
