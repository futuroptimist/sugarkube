# Pi Image Contributor Guide

This guide links every Pi image automation helper to the documentation that explains how to use it.
Use it when updating scripts or docs so releases, flashing workflows, and verifier reports stay in
sync.

## Keep docs and automation aligned

- Touching any file in `docs/` or `README.md`? Run the synchronized checks:
  ```bash
  make docs-verify
  # or
  just docs-verify
  ```
  Both commands execute `pyspelling -c .spellcheck.yaml` and
  `linkchecker --no-warnings README.md docs/` so every update keeps the documentation consistent
  with the automation helpers.
- Use `pre-commit run --all-files` to exercise `scripts/checks.sh`, which installs spellcheck and
  link-check dependencies automatically when missing.
- Ship changes with tests that deliver **100% patch coverage on the first `pytest` run**. Design
  tests before landing code so local runs (and CI) never require retries to close coverage gaps.
- When adding a new helper, update this mapping and reference it from the relevant guide so the
  quick-start and recovery docs stay authoritative.

    [Pi Token + dspace](./pi_token_dspace.md), [Sugarkube Helm Bundle Hooks](./pi_helm_bundles.md).

#### Record hardware boot runs

Run the smoke test harness against real hardware after image releases or major changes, then update
the README badge so contributors know the last verified boot date:

```sh
just update-hardware-badge \
  BADGE_ARGS="--status pass --timestamp 2025-02-15T16:00:00Z --notes 'Pi 4B cluster'"
```

Key flags:

- `--status`: `pass`, `warn`, `fail`, or `unknown`; selects the badge colour and base label.
- `--timestamp`: ISO-8601 instant (UTC recommended). Use `now` to populate with the current time.
- `--notes`: short free-form annotation that appears after the timestamp (host, tester, etc.).
- `--description`: optional tooltip text for shields.io consumers.
- `--link`: hyperlink destination(s) for the badge. Supply once (or twice) to highlight reports.

The helper writes `docs/status/hardware-boot.json` and the README automatically renders the updated
badge via shields.io. Commit the refreshed JSON alongside your run notes so downstream operators can
trust the published status.

### Build workflows

- `scripts/build_pi_image.sh` and `scripts/build_pi_image.ps1`
  - Purpose: orchestrate pi-gen builds with cloud-init, token.place, and dspace baked into the
    image.
  - Primary docs: [Pi Image Quickstart](./pi_image_quickstart.md),
    [Pi Image Builder Design](./pi_image_builder_design.md).
  - Related tooling: triggered manually via shell or by the GitHub Actions release workflow.
- `scripts/checks.sh`
  - Purpose: unify linting, spellcheck, link-check, CAD, and KiCad validations in CI and local
    development.
  - Primary docs: [Pi Image Quickstart](./pi_image_quickstart.md),
    [README](../README.md), and [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
  - Related tooling: run via `pre-commit run --all-files` and from `scripts/sugarkube_doctor.sh`.

When you adjust any helper above, update the referenced docs and regenerate spellcheck/link-check via
`make docs-verify` to keep the automation story coherent for new contributors.
