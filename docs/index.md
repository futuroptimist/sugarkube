# Sugarkube

Welcome to **sugarkube**, a solar-powered off-grid platform for Raspberry Pi and aquarium aeration. This repo tracks CAD models, electronics schematics, and documentation so anyone can replicate the setup.
Greenery is encouraged around the cube. Vines can climb the extrusion while herbs and shade-loving plants enjoy the cover of the solar panels.

## Getting Started
- [build_guide.md](build_guide.md) — step-by-step assembly instructions
- [pi_cluster_carrier.md](pi_cluster_carrier.md) — details on the Raspberry Pi mounting plate
- [insert_basics.md](insert_basics.md) — heat-set inserts and printed threads
- [network_setup.md](network_setup.md) — connect the cluster to your network

## Learn the Fundamentals
- [solar_basics.md](solar_basics.md) — how photovoltaic panels work
- [electronics_basics.md](electronics_basics.md) — wiring, tools, and safety
- [power_system_design.md](power_system_design.md) — sizing batteries and choosing a charge controller

Start with the basics and progress toward a fully autonomous solar cube.
