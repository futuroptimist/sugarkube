## Getting Started
- [build_guide.md](build_guide.md) — step-by-step assembly instructions
- [pi_cluster_carrier.md](pi_cluster_carrier.md) — details on the Raspberry Pi mounting plate
- [insert_basics.md](insert_basics.md) — heat-set inserts and printed threads

## Learn the Fundamentals
- [solar_basics.md](solar_basics.md) — how photovoltaic panels work
- [electronics_basics.md](electronics_basics.md) — wiring, tools, and safety
- [power_system_design.md](power_system_design.md) — sizing batteries and choosing a charge controller

Start with the basics and progress toward a fully autonomous solar cube.
