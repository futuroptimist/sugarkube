# Build Guide

This project uses 20x20 aluminium extrusion to suspend four 100W solar panels around a cube.  The battery, charge controller and electronics mount inside a marine battery box and small junction box.

1. Print the brackets from `cad/solar_cube`.  STL files are generated by GitHub Actions and stored under `stl/`.
2. Assemble the extrusion cube using M5 hardware.
3. Mount the solar panels using the printed brackets.
4. Wire the panels to the Victron MPPT charge controller as shown in the `elex/power_ring` schematic.
5. Install the 12V air pump and Raspberry Pi behind a 15A breaker and 5A fuse respectively.
6. Connect the battery and verify voltage before powering devices.
