# Mac mini station

Press-fit saddle cap extension for the Mac mini M4 keyboard station.
The cap slides over the existing top saddle and widens the keyboard tray so a Magic Keyboard
or TKL board will not tip off when bumped.

## Usage

1. Open `hardware/mac-mini-station/scad/mac_mini_station.scad` in OpenSCAD and set
   `keyboard_width_mm` to match your board. Uncomment the full-width preset or keep the
   default tenkeyless value.
2. From the repository root run `hardware/mac-mini-station/scripts/build.sh` to export STL
   files into `hardware/mac-mini-station/stl/`. The script requires
   [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org/) on your `PATH`.
3. Print the cap upside down without supports.
4. Start with `press_fit_clearance_mm = 0.35` and adjust after a test fit.
