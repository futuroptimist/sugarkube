# Mac mini station

Press-fit saddle cap extension for the Mac mini M4 keyboard station. The cap slides over the existing top saddle and widens the keyboard tray so a Magic Keyboard or TKL board will not tip off when bumped.

## Usage

1. Pick a keyboard width preset in `hardware/mac-mini-station/scad/mac_mini_station.scad`.
2. Run `scripts/build.sh` to export STL files.
3. Print the cap upside down without supports.
4. Start with `press_fit_clearance_mm = 0.35` and adjust after a test fit.
