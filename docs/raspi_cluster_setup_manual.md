# Raspberry Pi Cluster Setup (Manual Path)

Prefer the sugar-coated flow? Start with [raspi_cluster_setup.md](raspi_cluster_setup.md) for the
one-command bring-up. This manual retains the previous deep-dive with every preparatory and
verification step spelled out.

## Bill of Materials
- 3 × Raspberry Pi 5 (8 GB recommended)
- 3 × official Raspberry Pi M.2 HAT with NVMe SSDs
- 1 × triple Pi carrier plate (see [pi_cluster_carrier.md](pi_cluster_carrier.md))
- Active airflow. If you skip the carrier stack's built-in fan, position a small desk fan so the
  boards stay below 60 °C—thermal throttling starts at 80 °C and spot-checks fail above 60 °C.
- Power supplies, standoffs, and required cables
- MicroSD card for each node (8 GB minimum)
- Optional KVM for shared keyboard, video, and mouse access

## Prerequisites
- A workstation with [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) installed
- Basic networking knowledge. Review [network_setup.md](network_setup.md) for static IPs
- SSH client (e.g. `ssh` on macOS/Linux or PuTTY on Windows)
- Internet connection to download images and packages

## Fast path: bootstrap all three nodes automatically
1. Copy [`samples/pi-cluster/three-node.toml`](../samples/pi-cluster/three-node.toml) to a
   writable directory and edit it to match your hardware:
   - Update `device` entries with the removable drives for each Pi.
   - Set `hostname`, Wi-Fi credentials, and SSH keys once and reuse them across nodes.
   - Adjust the `cluster.join` section with your control-plane hostname or IPs.
   - The sample now ships with `[image.workflow] trigger = true`, so the helper automatically
     dispatches the `pi-image` workflow, waits for the run to finish, and downloads the artifact
     without leaving the terminal. Disable it (`trigger = false`) when you already have a fresh
     image cached locally.
2. Preview the workflow without touching hardware:
   ```bash
   python -m sugarkube_toolkit pi cluster --config ./cluster.toml --dry-run
   ```
   The helper prints the commands it would execute (download, flash, join) so you can validate
   device paths and arguments before proceeding.
3. Drop `--dry-run` when you're ready:
   ```bash
   python -m sugarkube_toolkit pi cluster --config ./cluster.toml
   ```
   The automation dispatches the `pi-image` workflow (when `image.workflow.trigger` is enabled),
   waits for the build to complete, downloads the artifact (or reuses an existing
   `install_sugarkube_image.sh` cache), flashes each SD card via `flash_pi_media_report.py`, copies
   per-node cloud-init overrides that inject the hostnames and Wi-Fi credentials you supplied, and
   finally runs `pi_multi_node_join_rehearsal.py --apply` to bring the workers online. Use
   `just cluster-bootstrap CLUSTER_BOOTSTRAP_ARGS="--config ./cluster.toml"` when you prefer Just
   recipes.

Skip to [§5](#5-form-the-k3s-cluster) after the helper completes—the control-plane and workers
will already share the same image, hostname overrides, and join token.

## 1. Prepare the OS image
1. Trigger the build in GitHub:
   - If you used the `[image.workflow] trigger = true` default, the cluster bootstrapper already
     dispatched the workflow and downloaded the artifact for you—skip to step 2.
   - Otherwise open [Actions → pi-image → Run workflow][pi-image], enable **token.place** and
     **dspace** if you want those repos baked in, then download `sugarkube.img.xz` with
     `scripts/download_pi_image.sh` or from the workflow run page.

   Alternatively, build locally:
   - Linux/macOS: `./scripts/build_pi_image.sh`
   - Windows (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     # Optional: increase WSL/WSL2 resources for Docker Desktop (recommended)
     # File: C:\Users\<you>\.wslconfig
     # [wsl2]
     # memory=64GB
     # processors=24
     # swap=16GB
     # localhostForwarding=true
     # vmIdleTimeout=7200
     # Then apply and rerun build:
     wsl --shutdown

     # Build the image
     powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build_pi_image.ps1
     ```
     Notes:
     - Requires Docker Desktop running and Git for Windows installed
     - The script auto-falls back to a Dockerized build and sets up binfmt/qemu
     - Expect 45–120 minutes on Windows; ensure ≥30 GB free disk
2. Verify the checksum: `sha256sum -c sugarkube.img.xz.sha256`
3. Flash the image to a microSD card using Raspberry Pi Imager
   - Set a unique hostname (e.g., `sugar-01`, `sugar-02`, `sugar-03`), enable SSH, and create a user
     with a strong password.
   - Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to open advanced options and configure the
     WiFi SSID, password, and locale.
   - The same image can be reused for all nodes.

## 2. Boot and clone to SSD
1. Insert the card into a Pi on the carrier and power on with monitor or KVM attached
2. Verify the NVMe drive shows up: `lsblk`
3. Preview the clone plan: `sudo ./scripts/ssd_clone.py --target /dev/sda --dry-run`
   (replace `/dev/sda` with your NVMe target).
4. Execute the clone once you're comfortable with the plan:
   ```bash
   sudo ./scripts/ssd_clone.py --target /dev/sda
   ```
   - If power hiccups or cables disconnect mid-transfer, rerun with `--resume` to continue
     from the last completed step without restarting the whole clone.
5. Shut down the Pi, remove the SD card, and power back on to confirm the SSD boots.

## 3. Enable SSD boot (if needed)
1. Run `sudo raspi-config` → Advanced Options → Boot Order → `NVMe/USB`
2. Reboot and confirm `lsblk` shows the root filesystem on the SSD

## 4. Repeat for remaining Pis
Follow the steps above for each node so every Pi boots from its own SSD.

## 5. Form the k3s cluster
1. On the first Pi (control plane):
   ```bash
   curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | sh -
   ```
2. Note the node token in `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token` (it is also copied
   to `/boot/sugarkube-node-token`) and the Pi's IP address
3. Before inviting other nodes, run a rehearsal from your workstation to confirm the token is
   mirrored and workers can reach the API:
    ```bash
    make rehearse-join \
      REHEARSAL_ARGS="sugar-control.local --agents sugar-worker-a.local "\
      "sugar-worker-b.local"
    ```
   The helper prints the join command template and checks each worker for network reachability,
   existing `k3s-agent` state, and leftover registration files.
4. Happy path for a three-node cluster (one control-plane plus two workers):
    ```bash
    make cluster-up \
      CLUSTER_ARGS="sugar-control.local --agents sugar-worker-a.local sugar-worker-b.local "\
      "--apply --apply-wait"
    ```
   The automation aborts if a worker fails the preflight, executes the join command remotely when
   the checks pass, and waits up to five minutes for every node to report `Ready`. Override the
   timeout with `--apply-wait-timeout` when slower networks need more time.
5. Prefer a manual join? Run the command emitted during the rehearsal on each worker:
   ```bash
   curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io | \
   K3S_URL=https://<control-ip>:6443 K3S_TOKEN=<token> sh -
   ```
6. Check that all nodes are ready:
   ```bash
   sudo kubectl get nodes
   ```
7. (Optional) Copy `/boot/sugarkube-kubeconfig-full` to your workstation for remote
   `kubectl` access.

## 6. Deploy applications
1. Clone the repositories:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/futuroptimist/token.place.git
   git clone https://github.com/democratizedspace/dspace.git
   cd dspace && git checkout v3
   ```
2. Apply Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts to launch services:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

## 7. Expose with Cloudflare Tunnel
1. Edit `/opt/sugarkube/docker-compose.cloudflared.yml` if needed (cloud-init installs it)
2. Store the tunnel token in `/opt/sugarkube/.cloudflared.env`
3. Start the tunnel service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable --now cloudflared-compose
   ```
4. Confirm the service is active:
   ```bash
   systemctl status cloudflared-compose --no-pager
   ```

## 8. Create environments
Use k3s namespaces `dev`, `int`, and `prod` to separate deployments.
CI can promote images between namespaces after validation.

## 9. Promote to production
Tag a release in the integration namespace as golden and deploy that tag to `prod`.
Roll back by redeploying the previous known-good tag if needed.
