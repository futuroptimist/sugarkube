# Codex Tests Prompt

Use this prompt when adding or updating tests.

```
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the sugarkube repository focused on tests.

PURPOSE:
Improve and maintain test coverage.

CONTEXT:
- Tests live in `tests/` and use `pytest`.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to lint, format, test, and check docs.
- Use `pytest` for faster feedback.
- Follow [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and [`README.md`](../README.md).

REQUEST:
1. Identify missing or flaky test cases.
2. Write or update tests in `tests/`.
3. Adjust implementation if a test exposes a bug.
4. Re-run `pre-commit run --all-files`; use `pytest` during development.

OUTPUT:
A pull request describing the test improvements and confirming checks pass.
```
