# Codex Tests Prompt

Use this prompt when adding or updating tests.

```
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the sugarkube repository focused on tests.

PURPOSE:
Improve and maintain test coverage.

CONTEXT:
- Tests live in [`tests/`](../tests/) and use `pytest`.
- Follow [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and [`README.md`](../README.md).
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files` to lint, format, and test.
- For documentation updates, also run `pyspelling -c .spellcheck.yaml` (requires
  `aspell` and `aspell-en`) and `linkchecker --no-warnings README.md docs/`.
- Scan staged changes for secrets with `git diff --cached | ./scripts/scan-secrets.py`
  before committing.

REQUEST:
1. Identify missing or flaky test cases.
2. Write or update tests in `tests/`.
3. Adjust implementation if a test exposes a bug.
4. Re-run `pre-commit run --all-files`.
5. Scan staged changes for secrets before committing.

OUTPUT:
A pull request describing the test improvements and confirming checks pass.
```
