# Electronics Essentials

Beginners can start here to learn the fundamentals needed to assemble the power system and troubleshoot issues.

## Basic Concepts
- **Voltage** is the potential difference between two points. A standard USB supply provides 5 V.
- **Current** is the rate of flow measured in amperes (A).
- **Resistance** follows Ohm's law: `V = I × R`.
- **Power** equals voltage times current (P = V × I).

### Measuring
- Use a multimeter to check voltage at the battery terminals.
- Never measure resistance on a powered circuit; disconnect power first to protect your meter.
- Clamp meters allow measuring current without breaking the circuit.

### Soldering Tips
- Keep the iron around 350 °C for most lead-free solder.
- Tin both surfaces before joining wires.
- Wipe the tip on a damp sponge or brass wool to keep it clean.
- Work in a ventilated area and wear eye protection.

### Common Components
- **Fuses** protect against short circuits.
- **Breakers** act like resettable fuses.
- **Buck converters** step down voltage to power your Raspberry Pi.

## Recommended Tools
- Digital multimeter
- Adjustable soldering iron with stand
- Wire strippers and crimpers
- Assortment of heat shrink and connectors

Understanding these basics helps you diagnose problems and build reliable circuits.
