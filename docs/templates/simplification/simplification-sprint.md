# Simplification Sprint Template

## Scope
- Theme or friction targeted (e.g., flashing UX, docs onboarding, CI hygiene).
- Timebox and participants (include on-call or async reviewers).
- Dependencies or prerequisites that must land first.

## Constraints
- Tooling limitations, hardware availability, or access requirements.
- Quality bars that must remain untouched (coverage, lint, reproducibility).
- Known risks or mitigations.

## Success Metrics
- Quantitative wins (reduced steps, faster setup, fewer support tickets).
- Qualitative wins (clearer docs, happier contributors, smoother demos).
- Evidence collection plan (reports, recordings, surveys).

## Execution Plan
- Kickoff checklist (sync agenda, roles, tracking doc).
- Daily/async status ritual and reporting expectations.
- Wrap-up deliverables (demo, retro, docs PRs, changelog entry).

## Follow-up
- Archive outputs in `notes/simplification/` or the relevant project folder.
- File follow-on tasks for backlog items out of scope.
- Schedule a retrospective with action items.
