# Simplification Templates

These templates accelerate the workstreams highlighted in
[simplification_suggestions.md](../../simplification_suggestions.md). Copy a
file, replace the placeholder callouts, and link the resulting artifact from the
relevant proposal, retro, or documentation PR.

- `onboarding-update.md` — summarize a change to the onboarding path before
  updating docs or automation.
- `prompt-refresh.md` — capture prompt deltas, rationale, and coverage before
  opening a PR that edits `docs/prompts/`.
- `simplification-sprint.md` — scope and align a focused simplification push,
  including deliverables, staffing, and metrics.

All templates end with an **Actions** checklist so contributors can track
reviews, docs updates, and verification steps. Archive the completed files in
`notes/` or the relevant project folder once the initiative wraps.
