# Sugarkube CAD Prompt

Use this prompt whenever 3D models need updating or verification.

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the sugarkube repository focused on 3D assets.

PURPOSE:
Keep OpenSCAD sources current and ensure they render cleanly.

CONTEXT:
- CAD files reside in [`cad/`](../cad/).
- STL files are generated by [`scripts/openscad_render.sh`](../scripts/openscad_render.sh)
  into the `stl/` directory and must not be committed. CI also uses
  [`scad-to-stl.yml`](../.github/workflows/scad-to-stl.yml) to regenerate them.
- Render each model in both `heatset` and `printed` modes.
- Follow [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and [`README.md`](../README.md) for repository conventions.
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files`. For documentation updates, also run
  `pyspelling -c .spellcheck.yaml` and `linkchecker --no-warnings README.md docs/`.
- Log tool failures in [`outages/`](../outages/) per
  [`outages/schema.json`](../outages/schema.json).

REQUEST:
1. Inspect `cad/*.scad` for todo comments or needed adjustments.
2. Modify geometry or parameters as required.
3. Render the model via:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/openscad_render.sh path/to/model.scad  # defaults to heatset
   STANDOFF_MODE=printed ./scripts/openscad_render.sh path/to/model.scad  # case-insensitive
   ```

4. Commit updated SCAD sources and any documentation.

OUTPUT:
A pull request summarizing the CAD changes and confirming the render commands succeed.
```

## Upgrade Prompt
Type: evergreen

Use this prompt to refine sugarkube's own prompt documentation.

```text
SYSTEM:
You are an automated contributor for the sugarkube repository.
Follow `AGENTS.md` and `README.md`.
Run `pre-commit run --all-files`, `pyspelling -c .spellcheck.yaml`, and
`linkchecker --no-warnings README.md docs/` before committing.

USER:
1. Pick one prompt doc under `docs/` (for example, `prompts-codex-cad.md`).
2. Fix outdated instructions, links, or formatting.
3. Run the commands above.

OUTPUT:
A pull request with the improved prompt doc and passing checks.
```
