# Sugarkube Fundamentals

Use this index whenever you need to revisit the shared concepts that power both the physical enclosure
and the automation that runs on top of it. Each primer below stays focused on foundational knowledge
so persona-specific guides can reference them without repeating content.

## Core Primers
- [Electronics Basics](../electronics_basics.md) — refresh component terminology, measurement
  techniques, and safety habits before soldering or probing circuits.
- [Solar Basics](../solar_basics.md) — understand how panel output, charge controllers, and battery
  chemistry interact so you can right-size off-grid deployments.
- [Insert Basics](../insert_basics.md) — review heat-set insert tooling and best practices shared by
  enclosure fixtures across the hardware build.

## Planning References
- [Power System Design](../power_system_design.md) — calculate loads, cable runs, and protection
  components for new installations.
- [Networking Fundamentals](../tutorials/tutorial-03-networking-internet-basics.md) — rehearse IP
  addressing, routing, and bandwidth planning before scaling the cluster.
- [Computing Foundations](../tutorials/tutorial-01-computing-foundations.md) — revisit shell fluency,
  version control, and scripting patterns that the automation stack expects.

## How to Use This Section
1. Start here when onboarding new contributors so they develop a consistent vocabulary before diving
   into persona-specific runbooks.
2. Link back to this page from new guides whenever you introduce a concept covered in these primers
   instead of duplicating the explanation.
3. Propose additional fundamentals through pull requests when you discover repeated background
   content that would benefit both hardware and software audiences.
