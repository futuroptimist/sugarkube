# Feature Brief Placeholder

Start each onboarding investigation by copying
`docs/templates/simplification/onboarding-update.md` into this workspace and
renaming it to match the effort (for example,
`feature-brief-2025-03-15.md`). Replace this placeholder with the populated
brief once you have documented the context, failing behavior, reproduction
steps, remediation plan, and follow-up actions. Keeping a committed stub ensures
repository documentation that references `notes/onboarding/feature-brief.md`
remains accurate until your first brief lands.
