# Skipped Tests Status and Roadmap

**Date**: 2025-11-09 (Updated)  
**Context**: Documentation of all skipped tests in the repository and recommendations for future PRs

## Summary

As of 2025-11-09, there are **2 skipped tests** in the BATS test suite:
- 2 complex k3s integration tests (discover_flow.bats: "joins existing server", "remains follower")

All Python tests pass without skips (850+ tests).

**Test Count History**:
- After PR #4 (2025-11-05): 36 pass, 5 skip (l4_probe tests enabled via ncat installation)
- After PR #5 (2025-11-05): 37 pass, 4 skip (Test 33 dbus wait retry logic implemented)
- After PR #6 (2025-11-07): 37 pass, 4 skip (Python 3.14 fixes)
- After PR #7 (2025-11-07): 38 pass, 3 skip (Test 34 absence gate + l4_probe confirmation)
- After PR #8 (2025-11-07): 38 pass, 3 skip (CI parity improvements - gdbus explicitly installed)
- After PR #9 (2025-11-09): 39 pass, 2 skip (Test "elects winner" now passing with systemctl stub fix)

## Detailed Skip Analysis

### 1. discover_flow.bats - K3s Integration Tests (2 skipped)

**Note on Test Naming**: To avoid confusion, we reference tests by their full quoted names from `@test "..."` declarations, not by positional numbers which can be ambiguous.

**Tests Currently Skipped**:
- ⏭️ **"discover flow joins existing server when discovery succeeds"** (line 505, 5th test in file)
- ⏭️ **"discover flow remains follower after self-check failure"** (line 737, 7th test in file)

**Tests Now Passing**:
- ✅ **"discover flow elects winner after self-check failure"** (line 595, 6th test in file) - FIXED 2025-11-09 PR #9

**Skip Reason**: Complex integration tests requiring k3s installation and multi-node orchestration

**Root Cause**:
- These tests invoke the full k3s discovery and installation flow
- "joins existing server" test calls `k3s-discover.sh` which attempts to:
  - Acquire join gate lock
  - Run L4 network probes
  - Execute actual k3s installation (downloads from https://get.k3s.io)
  - Perform multi-node cluster joining
- Current stub infrastructure doesn't fully mock k3s installation process
- Tests time out after 60+ seconds waiting for k3s operations

**Investigation Results & Progress**:

**2025-11-09 - "elects winner" Test FIXED (PR #9)**:
- ✅ Test "discover flow elects winner after self-check failure" now PASSING
- **Root cause identified**: systemctl stub missing 'reload' and 'restart' command handling
- **Fix applied**: Extended stub_common_network_tools() to handle all systemctl operations
- **Result**: Test passes consistently in <5 seconds
- **Outage**: outages/2025-11-09-discover-flow-test6-systemctl-stub.json
- **Time**: 15 minutes (building on 2025-11-08 investigation)

**2025-11-08 - Stub Infrastructure Implementation**:
- **First attempt (20 min)**: Added `SUGARKUBE_SKIP_K3S_INSTALL` flag - tests still hung
- **Second attempt (90 min)**: Implemented proper stubbing infrastructure following "understand real use case" principle
  - Read docs/raspi_cluster_setup.md to understand actual Pi cluster workflow
  - Realized tests validate **mDNS discovery & join decision logic**, NOT k3s installation
  - Created `run_k3s_install()` wrapper function with `SUGARKUBE_K3S_INSTALL_SCRIPT` override
  - Added `create_k3s_install_stub()` and `create_l4_probe_stub()` test helpers
  - Updated all 4 k3s installation call sites to use new wrapper
  - Added environment variable overrides (tokens, timeouts)
- **Result**: Infrastructure reusable across all 3 tests
- **Documentation**: 
  - Full investigation: notes/k3s-integration-tests-investigation-20251108.md
  - Outages: outages/2025-11-08-k3s-integration-tests-investigation.json
  - Stub implementation: outages/2025-11-08-k3s-integration-tests-stub-infrastructure.json

**Revised Estimated Effort** (based on actual progress):
- ✅ "elects winner" test: 15 minutes (COMPLETED 2025-11-09)
- ⚙️ "joins existing server" test: 15-20 minutes (infrastructure done, needs debugging)
- ⚙️ "remains follower" test: 10-15 minutes (infrastructure done, needs validation)
- **Total remaining**: ~25-35 minutes to complete remaining 2 tests

**Key Learning**: Original "4-8 hours per test" estimates were based on XY problem (trying to skip k3s install vs understanding what to test). Actual solution: stub external dependencies, test decision logic. Infrastructure reusable across all tests.

**Previous Investigation Results (2025-11-07 PR #8)**:
- Different approach attempted (details not fully documented)
- Test 6 initially passed
- Tests 7-8 entered infinite loops in bootstrap election and follower state machines
- Changes broke existing Test 5 (bootstrap publish flow)
- Conclusion: Careful refactoring of control flow logic required

**Complexity**: MEDIUM (revised down from HIGH after infrastructure implementation)
- ✅ k3s installation stubbing: DONE via `run_k3s_install()` wrapper
- ✅ Test helpers created: `create_k3s_install_stub()`, `create_l4_probe_stub()`
- ⚙️ Additional debugging needed: Test 6 exit code issue (~15-20 min)
- ⚙️ Tests 7-8 validation: Quick verification needed (~10-15 min)

**Actual Time Spent** (2025-11-08):
- Infrastructure implementation: 90 minutes (including XY problem resolution)
- Remaining work: ~30 minutes
- **Total**: ~2 hours for all 3 tests (vs original 12-24 hour estimate)

**Recommended Approach** (UPDATED 2025-11-08):
**Option A - Comprehensive Stubbing** ✅ IMPLEMENTED:
   - ✅ Created `run_k3s_install()` wrapper to stub k3s installation
   - ✅ Added `SUGARKUBE_K3S_INSTALL_SCRIPT` override following existing patterns
   - ✅ Created test helpers for k3s install and L4 probe stubs
   - ✅ Tests now run without hanging (<5 seconds vs 60+ seconds)
   - ✅ Infrastructure reusable across all 3 tests
   - ⚙️ Minor debugging needed to complete (est. 30 min remaining)
   - Pros: ✅ Tests run in CI, ✅ validate script logic, ✅ fast execution
   - Cons: May not catch real k3s integration issues (acceptable for unit tests)

Option B & C remain valid for future comprehensive E2E testing but are not needed for these specific tests which focus on discovery/decision logic.

**Next Steps** (UPDATED 2025-11-08):
1. ✅ Read docs/raspi_cluster_setup.md to understand real use case
2. ✅ Implement stubbing infrastructure for k3s installation
3. ✅ Remove skip directives and add test helpers
4. ⚙️ Debug Test 6 non-zero exit (15-20 min) - partial issue with script flow
5. ⚙️ Validate Tests 7-8 pass with current infrastructure (10-15 min)
6. ⚙️ Create final outage entries and update notes (~5 min)

**Total remaining work**: ~30 minutes for complete Test 6-8 passing

### 2. l4_probe.bats - Network Tool Tests (COMPLETED - 2025-11-07 PR #7)

**Tests**:
- ~~Test 1: "l4_probe reports open port as open"~~ ✅ NOW PASSING
- ~~Test 2: "l4_probe exits non-zero when a port is closed"~~ ✅ NOW PASSING

**Original Skip Reason**: Missing `ncat` (netcat) binary in test environment

**Root Cause**:
- Tests conditionally skip if `ncat` is not available: `command -v ncat >/dev/null 2>&1 || skip "ncat not available"`
- `l4_probe.sh` script uses `ncat` for TCP port connectivity checks
- GitHub Actions runners have `ncat` installed (see .github/workflows/ci.yml:37)
- Tests were skipped in local environments without ncat but always passed in CI

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED (2025-11-07 PR #7)
- Verified ncat is already in CI environment
- Tests pass automatically when ncat available (conditional skip logic)
- No code changes needed - this was a documentation issue only

**Complexity**: LOW

**Actual Effort**: ~5 minutes
- Verify ncat in CI: 2 minutes
- Run tests locally with ncat: 2 minutes
- Create outage documentation: 1 minute

**Outage Documentation**: `outages/2025-11-07-l4-probe-ncat-already-available.json`

### 3. mdns_selfcheck.bats - Test 33: DBus Wait Logic (FIXED - 2025-11-05 PR #5)

**Test**: "mdns dbus self-check waits for avahi bus before browsing"

**Status**: ✅ NOW PASSING

**Original Skip Reason**: Needed `wait_for_avahi_dbus_gdbus` retry logic with ServiceUnknown error detection

**Root Cause**:
- Test expects script to retry when `gdbus introspect` returns ServiceUnknown error during Avahi startup
- Original implementation used busctl-based wait logic which didn't detect ServiceUnknown errors
- Test stubs gdbus to fail with ServiceUnknown on first 2 attempts, succeed on 3rd

**Fix Applied (2025-11-05 PR #5)**:
- Implemented `wait_for_avahi_dbus_gdbus()` function in `scripts/mdns_selfcheck_dbus.sh`
- Added ServiceUnknown error detection and retry logic with 0.5s sleep between attempts
- Function logs `event=avahi_dbus_ready outcome=ok` when service becomes available
- Integrated into mdns_selfcheck_dbus.sh startup sequence (lines 318-374)

**Complexity**: MEDIUM (as predicted)

**Actual Effort**: ~45 minutes
- Implement wait_for_avahi_dbus_gdbus() function: 20 minutes
- Add ServiceUnknown error detection and retry: 15 minutes
- Test and validate: 10 minutes

**Outage Documentation**: See `outages/2025-11-05-mdns-selfcheck-test-33-dbus-wait-retry.json` (if created in PR #5)

**References**:

### 4. mdns_selfcheck.bats - Test 34: Absence Gate (COMPLETED - 2025-11-07 PR #7)

**Test**: "mdns absence gate confirms wipe leaves no advertisements"

**Status**: ✅ NOW PASSING

**Original Skip Reason**: Test timed out waiting for mdns_absence_gate logic to complete

**Root Cause**: 
- Test runs `k3s-discover.sh` which calls `ensure_mdns_absence_gate()` function
- The absence gate has complex retry logic with timeouts and backoffs (default 15 seconds)
- Default MDNS_ABSENCE_TIMEOUT_MS=15000ms caused test to exceed 30s timeout
- avahi-publish stubs used `sleep 60 &` blocking calls that couldn't be interrupted
- Test expects `mdns_absence_confirmed=1` after node wipe leaves no mDNS advertisements

**Fix Applied (2025-11-07 PR #7)**:
1. Added timeout environment variables to test setup:
   - `MDNS_ABSENCE_TIMEOUT_MS=2000` (reduced from 15000ms)
   - `MDNS_ABSENCE_BACKOFF_START_MS=100` (reduced from 500ms)
   - `MDNS_ABSENCE_BACKOFF_CAP_MS=500` (reduced from 4000ms)

2. Refactored avahi-publish stubs to use trap handlers:
   ```bash
   trap 'exit 0' TERM INT
   while true; do
     sleep 0.1
   done
   ```
   Instead of non-interruptible `sleep 60 &`

**Result**: Test now completes in ~3-4 seconds instead of timing out

**Complexity**: MEDIUM (investigation already done in notes)

**Actual Effort**: ~15 minutes
- Apply timeout overrides: 5 minutes
- Fix stub trap handlers: 5 minutes
- Test and validate: 5 minutes

**Outage Documentation**: `outages/2025-11-07-mdns-absence-gate-timeout-fix.json`

## Test Skip Guidelines for Future Development

When adding a test skip directive:

1. **Always include context**:
   ```bash
   # TODO: <Brief description of issue>
   # Root cause: <What's blocking>
   # Estimated fix: <Time estimate>
   skip "<User-facing reason>"
   ```

2. **Update this document**:
   - Add entry to relevant section
   - Document root cause and estimated effort
   - Propose approach for fixing

3. **Create tracking issue**:
   - Link from skip comment
   - Reference in this document
   - Add to roadmap

4. **Avoid indefinite skips**:
   - Every skip should have removal plan
   - If test is no longer valid, remove it (don't skip)
   - Consider if test belongs in different suite (unit vs E2E)

5. **Prefer conditional skips over permanent ones**:
   ```bash
   command -v ncat >/dev/null 2>&1 || skip "ncat not available"
   ```
   This allows tests to pass when conditions are met.
