# Feature Brief Index

Documentation references `notes/feature-brief.md` when describing how to record
onboarding investigations. This stub keeps those links accurate by pointing to
the maintained template under `notes/onboarding/feature-brief.md`.

Use the onboarding workspace directly:

- [notes/onboarding/feature-brief.md](onboarding/feature-brief.md) — seed brief
  that mirrors the onboarding template.
- [docs/templates/simplification/onboarding-update.md](../docs/templates/simplification/onboarding-update.md)
  — copy this when you start documenting a change.

When you create your first brief, replace the stub inside `notes/onboarding/`.
