# Sugarkube

> Off-grid k3s cluster with solar power. Contains 3D printed parts, KiCad schematics and build docs.

Plants grow up and around the cube, taking advantage of the shade cast by the solar panels.
This repository provides hardware designs and instructions for building a
solar-powered Raspberry Pi cluster.
The word *sugarkube* is used both for the solar cube itself and for helper
scripts that provide "syntactic sugar" for Kubernetes.
