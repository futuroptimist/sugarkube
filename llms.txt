# Sugarkube

> Off-grid k3s cluster powered by solar. Houses 3D printed parts,
> KiCad schematics and build docs.

Plants grow around the aluminium cube, taking advantage of the shade cast
by its solar panels. This repo mixes hardware designs with scripts that make
deploying a solar-powered Raspberry Pi (k3s) cluster easier. The term
**sugarkube** refers both to the physical cube and to helper scripts offering
"syntactic sugar" for Kubernetes.
