  "rootCause": "When service type was missing from mDNS enumeration (_services._dns-sd._udp) but instances were found via active browse, the warning event was logged at DEBUG level only. Test expected event=mdns_type_check and severity=warn to be visible at INFO level without requiring LOG_LEVEL=debug, causing test failure on line 195.",
  "resolution": "Changed log level from log_debug to log_info for all mdns_type_check warning messages when present=0 (lines 119-170). This ensures enumeration miss warnings are visible by default, improving observability of mDNS discovery issues during cluster startup.",
