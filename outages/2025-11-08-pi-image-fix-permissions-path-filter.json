  "rootCause": "Changes to scripts/fix_pi_image_permissions.sh did not trigger the pi-image unit job because the pull_request.paths filter omitted the script. A regression merged that broke the permission fix step, and the next manual pi-image build failed when collect_pi_image.sh could not read the root-owned artifacts.",
  "resolution": "Include scripts/fix_pi_image_permissions.sh in the workflow path filter so future edits run the unit job, add automated tests that assert the path coverage, and exercise the fixer via a sudo-backed e2e test in CI to prove it restores ownership.",
