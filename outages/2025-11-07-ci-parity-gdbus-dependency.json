  "rootCause": "CI workflow did not explicitly install libglib2.0-bin package, which provides gdbus binary. While gdbus was available via transitive dependencies in Ubuntu runners, explicit installation ensures parity with local test environments and prevents future regressions if Ubuntu package dependencies change.",
  "resolution": "Added libglib2.0-bin to the apt-get install list in CI workflow. This ensures gdbus is always available for mDNS D-Bus tests (test 31: 'mdns self-check falls back to CLI when dbus unsupported') and maintains parity between local and CI test execution environments.",
