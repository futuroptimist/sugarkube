  "rootCause": "Multiple documentation files contained stale test count references (38/41, 39/41, 40/41) from PRs #7-10 instead of the current 100% pass rate (41/41) achieved in PR #11. This created confusion about the actual test suite status. Files affected: notes/2025-11-05-ci-test-status-verified.md (3 instances of 38/41), notes/ci-test-failures-remaining-work.md (1 instance of 38/41), notes/ci-test-fixes-action-plan.md (1 instance of 38/41), notes/k3s-integration-tests-investigation-20251108.md (references to 38/41), and notes/test-suite-xy-analysis-20251108.md (39/41 reference). The stale counts made it appear that work remained when all tests were actually passing.",
  "resolution": "Updated all documentation files to reflect the current 100% pass rate (41/41 tests passing, 0 failures, 0 skipped). Changes include: (1) Updated executive summaries to show 100% pass rate with celebration emojis, (2) Changed 'Skipped Tests' sections to 'Previously Skipped - Now FIXED!' sections with links to fix PRs, (3) Updated investigation documents to show final outcomes at the top, (4) Corrected test suite analysis to show 41/41 alignment (100%), (5) Added historical context noting the journey from 38/41 (92.7%) to 41/41 (100%) via PRs #9, #10, #11. All documentation now accurately reflects the complete test suite success achieved on 2025-11-09.",
