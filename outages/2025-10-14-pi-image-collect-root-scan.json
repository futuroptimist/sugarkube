  "component": "pi-image workflow",
  "rootCause": "The workflow invoked scripts/collect_pi_image.sh with '.' as the search root, so stray '*.img' or '*.img.xz' files outside deploy/ were discovered first. The collector then skipped the newly built image, uploading stale or incomplete artifacts and causing manual pi-image builds to fail validation downstream.",
  "resolution": "Update the workflow to pass deploy/ to scripts/collect_pi_image.sh so only pi-gen outputs are considered, and extend artifact detection tests plus workflow regression checks to guard the behavior.",
