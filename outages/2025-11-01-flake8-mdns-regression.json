  "rootCause": "Recent mDNS regression tests landed with 100+ character literals and an unused parse helper, tripping flake8's line-length and F841 checks in checks.sh.",
  "resolution": "Split long fixture literals across concatenated segments, rewrote shell stubs with textwrap to keep lines under 100 characters, and dropped the unused fields assignment so flake8 passes again.",

    "checks.sh failure: ./scripts/checks.sh (chunk 9d95b7)",
