  "component": "k3s-mdns-self-check",
  "rootCause": "mdns_selfcheck.sh stored hostname aliases as a newline-delimited string but iterated with a for-loop that never split on newlines, so host_matches_self() treated the entire alias list as one value and rejected legitimate mDNS records.",
  "resolution": "Replace the newline-sensitive for-loops with read loops so each alias is evaluated independently before comparing to the service target.",
