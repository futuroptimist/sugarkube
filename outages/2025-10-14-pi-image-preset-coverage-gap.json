  "rootCause": "Changes to scripts/download_pi_image.sh and scripts/render_pi_imager_preset.py did not trigger the pi-image unit job because the pull_request.paths filter omitted both files. The preset helper lost coverage, so a regression merged unnoticed and the next manual pi-image build failed when the preset renderer exited early.",
  "resolution": "Expanded the pi-image workflow path filters to cover the download helper and preset renderer, and added a render_pi_imager_preset end-to-end test with workflow assertions to guarantee the coverage stays in place.",
