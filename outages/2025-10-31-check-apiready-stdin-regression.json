  "rootCause": "The readyz gate's Python validator consumed no payload because the here-doc passed the checker code over STDIN, so redirecting the response body provided an empty stream. As a result the script always treated 200 responses as failures and the bats suite timed out while exercising check_apiready.sh.",
  "resolution": "Reworked validate_ready_body to read from the temporary response file explicitly and adjusted the test harness to bind an ephemeral HTTPS port, allowing the script to accept successful readyz responses and the tests to pass.",
