  "rootCause": "The verification step searched build logs for the exact UTF-8 string 'âœ… just command verified', but the pi-gen chroot runs under a POSIX locale that renders the emoji as '??', so the grep never matched even though the just verification succeeded.",
  "resolution": "Updated the builder to emit an ASCII '[sugarkube] just command verified' log line and relaxed the workflow check to search for the emoji-free substring. Added unit tests to keep the workflow and build script in sync.",
