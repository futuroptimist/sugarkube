  "rootCause": "After the 2025-11-10 test count correction and synchronization efforts, one documentation file still contained the outdated test count reference. Line 5 of test-suite-xy-analysis-20251108.md stated 'Analyzed all 41 BATS tests' in the methodology section, when the correct count is 42 tests. This was missed in the previous synchronization pass documented in outages/2025-11-10-test-count-documentation-synchronization.json, which updated 4 other files but overlooked this specific methodology line. The file did have a correction note at line 80, but the methodology section at the top remained inconsistent.",
  "resolution": "Updated line 5 of notes/test-suite-xy-analysis-20251108.md from '41 BATS tests' to '42 BATS tests' in the methodology section. This completes the documentation synchronization effort started on 2025-11-10. All notes files now consistently reference the correct test count of 42 tests total (40 pass locally + 2 conditionally skip; 42/42 pass in CI where ncat is installed). Verified no other documentation files contain the outdated '41 tests' count in active content (only historical references explaining the correction remain).",
