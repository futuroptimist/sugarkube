  "rootCause": "An upstream pi-gen refactor now only executes files named 'NN-run-chroot.sh'. Our just installer stayed at stage2/01-sys-tweaks/03-run-chroot-just.sh, so the script never ran, 'just' was missing from the image, and the '[sugarkube] just command verified' log line stopped appearing.",
  "resolution": "Install the script as 03-run-chroot.sh and symlink the legacy 03-run-chroot-just.sh path so pi-gen executes it while tests keep their context. Added regression coverage to assert the canonical script exists and the symlink resolves to it.",
