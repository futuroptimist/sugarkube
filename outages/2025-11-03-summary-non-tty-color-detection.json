  "rootCause": "Tests 40 and 41 in summary.bats failed with exit code 0 expected but received non-zero. These tests verify that the summary script correctly detects non-tty environments and dumb terminals to avoid emitting ANSI escape codes, but the script is exiting with errors instead of producing the expected output.",
  "resolution": "Investigate the summary script's tty detection logic and TERM environment variable handling. Verify that the script can run successfully in non-interactive environments and properly suppresses color codes when appropriate. Check for syntax errors or missing dependencies that might cause the script to fail.",
