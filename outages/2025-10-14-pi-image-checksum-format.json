  "rootCause": "collect_pi_image.sh wrote checksum files containing only the raw digest, so the workflow artifact could not be verified with 'sha256sum -c', causing manual pi-image builds to fail validation gates downstream.",
  "resolution": "Updated collect_pi_image.sh to include the artifact filename in the SHA-256 file and added regression tests to ensure sha256sum -c succeeds for every supported artifact format.",
