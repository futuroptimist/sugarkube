  "component": "scripts/k3s-discover.sh",
  "rootCause": "The bootstrap publish flow in k3s-discover.sh timed out waiting for Avahi to publish the mDNS service 'k3s-demo-test@runnervmf2e7y.local (bootstrap)'. The timeout occurred despite mdns_selfcheck reporting outcome=confirmed, suggesting a race condition or timing issue between service publication, mDNS propagation, and the verification step.",
  "resolution": "Increase bootstrap publication timeout, add retry logic for mDNS verification, or adjust timing between publish_avahi_service and ensure_self_mdns_advertisement calls.",
