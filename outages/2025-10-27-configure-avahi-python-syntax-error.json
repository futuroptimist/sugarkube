  "rootCause": "Python script embedded in configure_avahi.sh lacked proper error handling for file reading operations, causing syntax errors when processing Avahi configuration files with invalid content or encoding issues.",
  "resolution": "Added comprehensive try-catch error handling around file reading operations in the embedded Python script. The script now aborts with a clear error message when it cannot read the existing configuration file, preventing silent destruction of user configuration. This conservative approach ensures that existing configurations are preserved when there are transient permission or encoding issues.",
