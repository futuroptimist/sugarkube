  "rootCause": "Python script embedded in configure_avahi.sh lacked proper error handling for file reading operations, causing syntax errors when processing Avahi configuration files with invalid content or encoding issues.",
  "resolution": "Added comprehensive try-catch error handling around file reading operations in the embedded Python script, including specific error handling for encoding issues and file access problems. The script now gracefully handles malformed configuration files and provides clear error messages.",
