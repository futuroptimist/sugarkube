  "rootCause": "PR copilot/fix-ci-test-failures incorrectly claimed documentation showed outdated test count of 38/41 when it should be 40/41. This was based on a fundamental arithmetic error. The actual test counts are: discover_flow (8 total: 5 pass, 3 skip), l4_probe (2 pass), mdns_selfcheck (18 pass), mdns_wire_probe (4 pass), hostname_uniqueness (2 pass), election (2 pass), join_gate (2 pass), summary (2 pass), api_readyz_gate (1 pass) = 38 passing out of 41 total tests. The confusion arose because l4_probe tests 16-17 show as skipped locally without ncat, but pass in CI where ncat is installed - however, these 2 tests were already counted in the 38 passing tests, not additional tests.",
  "resolution": "Reverted incorrect changes from commit f8a67ca that changed test counts from 38/41 to 40/41 across notes files. Removed incorrect outage entry outages/2025-11-08-ci-test-count-documentation-sync.json. Original documentation showing 38/41 passing tests (92.7% pass rate) was correct. The l4_probe tests are part of the 38 passing tests in CI, not additional tests that increase the count to 40.",
