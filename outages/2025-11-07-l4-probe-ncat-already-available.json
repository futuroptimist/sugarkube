  "rootCause": "Tests 16-17 in l4_probe.bats were skipped locally due to missing ncat binary, but the CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci.yml:37) already installs ncat. Tests use conditional skip logic 'command -v ncat >/dev/null 2>&1 || skip' which automatically enables tests when ncat is available. This was a documentation issue rather than a test failure - the tests were already passing in CI.",
  "resolution": "Verified that ncat is already installed in CI environment and tests pass without code changes. Updated documentation in notes/ to reflect that l4_probe tests are working in CI. No outage occurred - this was a local environment configuration issue only.",
