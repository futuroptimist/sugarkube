  "rootCause": "Test failed because active query awk hang prevented active_found=1 from being set. When service type missing from enumeration but instances found via active browse, script should warn (severity=warn) and continue (exit 0), but instead exited early with code 4 due to active_found=0.",
  "resolution": "Fixed by resolving awk hang issue in mdns_type_check.sh:173-184. Active query now properly sets active_found=1 when instances discovered, allowing script to continue to main loop despite type_present=0.",
