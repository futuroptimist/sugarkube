  "rootCause": "The service type discovery step marked the requested mDNS type as present but failed to add it to the available_types list because the case statement exited before the wildcard branch ran, so downstream assertions never saw _k3s-sugar-dev._tcp in the catalog.",
  "resolution": "Record service types separately from the presence flag so the catalog always includes the requested type alongside other advertised protocols.",
