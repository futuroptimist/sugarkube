  "rootCause": "The Avahi parser left trailing dots on hostnames and TXT leader values when avahi-browse emitted a domain of 'local.', so the mDNS self-check never matched the bootstrap advertisement for the local node.",
  "resolution": "Trim trailing dots, normalise case, and reuse the hostname normaliser for both resolved hosts and TXT leader fields so bootstrap self-checks accept Avahi responses with domain suffixes.\n\n2025-12-08 follow-up: Bound avahi-publish-service with -H to the FQDN, added a 1s self-check delay, and capture output in /tmp/sugar-publish.log to prevent bootstrap races.\nQuick triage:\n- avahi-browse -rt _k3s-sugar-dev._tcp --parsable | sed -n '1,80p'\n- pgrep -a avahi-publish || true\n- sed -n '1,120p' /tmp/sugar-publish.log || true",
