  "component": "scripts/k3s_mdns_parser.py",
  "rootCause": "The Avahi parser left trailing dots on hostnames and TXT leader values when avahi-browse emitted a domain of 'local.', so the mDNS self-check never matched the bootstrap advertisement for the local node.",
  "resolution": "Trim trailing dots, normalise case, and reuse the hostname normaliser for both resolved hosts and TXT leader fields so bootstrap self-checks accept Avahi responses with domain suffixes.",
  "references": [

  ],
  "notes": [
    "2025-12-01 follow-up: mixed-case Avahi adverts caused the bootstrap self-check to miss our own publish on Pi nodes.",
    "Symptom: avahi-publish-service PID logged but the self-check aborted before confirmation, risking split brain.",
    "Fix: bind avahi-publish-service with -H <FQDN>, add a 1s pause before browsing, and normalize comparisons to ignore case/trailing dots.",
    "Captured avahi-publish output in /tmp/sugar-publish.log for quick inspection on affected devices.",
    "Quick triage: avahi-browse -rt _k3s-sugar-dev._tcp --parsable",
    "Quick triage: pgrep -a avahi-publish || true",
    "Quick triage: sed -n '1,120p' /tmp/sugar-publish.log || true"
