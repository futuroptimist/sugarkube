  "component": "scripts/k3s-discover.sh iptables preflight check",
  "rootCause": "The iptables binary was not installed on sugarkube1 during setup, causing the preflight check to report a warning. While k3s can install iptables during its own installation, the preflight check detects this early to provide visibility into the configuration.",
  "resolution": "Documented as expected behavior. The iptables preflight check is informational and reports 'outcome=warn' rather than failing. K3s will install iptables-nftables during installation if missing. Users can pre-install iptables with 'apt install iptables' if they want to avoid the warning.",
