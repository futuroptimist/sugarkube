  "rootCause": "actions/cache@v4 resolved to a build that still required the Node 20 runtime, so forcing JavaScript actions to Node24 caused the cache restore step to abort before the image build could start.",
  "resolution": "Pinned the workflow to actions/cache@v4.3.0 and actions/upload-artifact@v4.6.2, and added regression tests that enforce the pinned versions and verify the upstream tags exist.",
