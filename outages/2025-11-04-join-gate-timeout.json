  "rootCause": "Tests in join_gate.bats time out during execution. Similar to discover_flow, tests likely missing curl stubs for API checks or have dependencies on external services that cause indefinite waits.",
  "resolution": "Investigation needed: 1) Add curl stubs similar to discover_flow fixes, 2) Review test logic for network operation dependencies, 3) Ensure avahi-publish-service and avahi-browse stubs are working correctly, 4) Add timeout handling where appropriate.",
