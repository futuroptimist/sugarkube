  "rootCause": "Nodes entering bootstrap election never re-checked for newly published server adverts, so a follower that started slightly early kept self-electing even after an existing API node appeared, leading to a split-brain control-plane.",
  "resolution": "Abort bootstrap when an API advertisement is detected before or during the leadership loop, add a fixture sequence test mode, and cover the regression with unit tests.",
