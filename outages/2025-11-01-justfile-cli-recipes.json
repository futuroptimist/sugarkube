  "rootCause": "Several just recipes still carried legacy moustache spacing and indentation, so the regression guards for start-here, token-place, nvme-health, and clone-ssd failed when they attempted to match the CLI invocation format.",
  "resolution": "Normalized the affected recipes to use the `{{sugarkube_cli}}` convention and corrected the clone-ssd continuation indent so the tests recognize the guard clauses.",
