  "rootCause": "The legacy shell-based strip_quotes helper remained in the self-check parser, so shellcheck flagged the body of that function as unreachable and CI failed on Raspberry Pi images that run shellcheck scripts/*.sh.",
  "resolution": "Move quoting sanitisation into the awk parser with symmetric trimming, drop the unused shell helper, and add regression coverage that feeds quoted avahi-browse output through mdns_selfcheck.sh.",
