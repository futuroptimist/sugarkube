  "rootCause": "Makefile recipe lines 197, 198, 201, and 202 for the ci-simulate and ci-simulate-kcov targets were missing required tab characters at the beginning. Makefile syntax requires recipe lines to start with a tab character, not spaces. This error was hidden by the kcov test discovery issue which prevented pytest from running any tests.",
  "resolution": "Fixed Makefile syntax by adding tab characters before recipe commands on lines 197-198 (ci-simulate target) and 201-202 (ci-simulate-kcov target). Tests in test_docs_verify_wrapper.py now pass.",
