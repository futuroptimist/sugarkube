  "component": "tests/bats/mdns_selfcheck.bats:856",
  "rootCause": "Test 34 'mdns absence gate confirms wipe leaves no advertisements' timed out because the mdns_absence_gate function used default timeout values (15000ms) that exceeded the test's 30-second timeout. Additionally, avahi-publish and avahi-publish-address stubs used non-interruptible 'sleep 60' blocking calls that prevented the absence gate logic from properly terminating publisher processes.",
  "resolution": "Applied timeout overrides via environment variables (MDNS_ABSENCE_TIMEOUT_MS=2000, MDNS_ABSENCE_BACKOFF_START_MS=100, MDNS_ABSENCE_BACKOFF_CAP_MS=500) to reduce absence gate wait time from 15s to 2s. Refactored avahi-publish stubs to use trap handlers with short sleep loops (0.1s) instead of 60s blocking sleep, making them properly interruptible. Test now completes in ~3-4 seconds instead of timing out.",
