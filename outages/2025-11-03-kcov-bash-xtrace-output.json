  "component": "CI / test workflow",
  "rootCause": "Running BATS tests under kcov for code coverage causes bash's xtrace mode to be enabled or test assertions to be echoed. This results in test conditions like '[[ \"$output\" == *pattern* ]]' appearing in the captured output with each character escaped (e.g., '*\\e\\v\\e\\n\\t\\=\\a\\v\\a\\h\\i' for 'event='). The escaped test assertions get mixed with normal log output, breaking test expectations.",
  "resolution": "Disable xtrace during kcov execution, or configure kcov to exclude test framework code from tracing, or adjust BATS test assertions to account for the presence of debug output.",
