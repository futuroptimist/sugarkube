  "rootCause": "The render helper reused pi_carrier_stack.scad for non-existent export_part targets, yielding assembly previews named like carrier STLs and never exporting the stack-ready pi_carrier.scad plates. Packaging then shipped the preview carrier_level files in carriers/ and omitted the real stack-mount carriers entirely.",
  "resolution": "Render pi_carrier.scad with stack mounts for carriers, move carrier_level outputs to preview, and render fan adapters and walls from their dedicated SCAD sources so the stack artifact ships print-ready plates plus correctly placed previews.",
