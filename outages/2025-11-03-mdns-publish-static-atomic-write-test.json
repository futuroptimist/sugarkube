  "rootCause": "Test 39 'mdns_publish_static writes atomically without journal churn' expected script_status to equal 0 but received a non-zero exit code. This test verifies that service file writes are atomic and don't create unnecessary systemd journal entries, but the script is failing before completing successfully.",
  "resolution": "Debug the mdns_publish_static script execution in the test environment to identify why it's exiting with a non-zero status. Check for permission issues, missing dependencies, or stub configuration problems that might cause premature script termination.",
