  "rootCause": "A change to scripts/build_pi_image.sh skipped the pi-image unit job because the pull_request.paths filter did not include the build script, so regressions were not caught before the workflow-dispatch build ran and failed downstream.",
  "resolution": "The pi-image workflow now watches the build script paths, and regression tests assert that the pull_request.paths block covers the collector and builder entrypoints. A high-level e2e test exercises tests/artifact_detection_test.sh to keep the workflow smoke coverage in CI.",
