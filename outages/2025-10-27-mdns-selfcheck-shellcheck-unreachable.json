  "rootCause": "A retired shell-based quote trimmer lingered in mdns_selfcheck.sh even though the awk parser already handled quoting. ShellCheck flagged the helper's body as unreachable (SC2317), so the Pi image unit workflow aborted before running the rest of the suite.",
  "resolution": "Rely solely on the awk strip_quotes helper and add a single-quoted avahi fixture test so mdns_selfcheck.sh stays shellcheck-clean going forward.",
