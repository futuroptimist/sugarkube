  "rootCause": "log() function in configure_avahi.sh was unconditionally creating log directory with mkdir -p, causing script to exit when running without root permissions (set -e behavior)",
  "resolution": "Modified log() function to gracefully handle permission errors - if mkdir -p fails, logs to stderr only instead of failing the entire script",
