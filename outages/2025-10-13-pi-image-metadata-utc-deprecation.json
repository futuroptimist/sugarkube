  "date": "2025-10-13",
  "component": "pi-image workflow",
  "rootCause": "scripts/create_build_metadata.py relied on datetime.utcnow(), which is slated for removal in Python 3.13. When GitHub Actions updates its Python runtimes, the pi-image unit job's metadata smoke test crashes before writing metadata, causing the workflow to fail.",
  "resolution": "Switched metadata timestamp generation to timezone-aware datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc) via a shared helper and forced the e2e smoke test to treat DeprecationWarning as fatal so future regressions are caught ahead of time.",
  "references": [
    ".github/workflows/pi-image.yml",
