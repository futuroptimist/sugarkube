  "rootCause": "The join_gate.bats tests 14 and 15 (acquire/release state management and wait retries) failed with exit code 0 expected but received non-zero. These tests manage the publisher state during cluster join operations and may be affected by upstream mdns_selfcheck or test stub configuration issues.",
  "resolution": "Verify that join gate lock file management and retry logic are working correctly. Check if mdns_selfcheck or test fixture issues are causing cascade failures. Debug the specific exit codes and error messages from the failing tests.",
