  "rootCause": "run_configure_avahi() function was capturing $? after an if statement completed, which always returns 0 regardless of the command exit status, causing failures to be logged with status=0",
  "resolution": "Refactored to capture exit status immediately using '|| status=$?' pattern before the if statement completes, ensuring accurate error reporting",
