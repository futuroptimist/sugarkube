  "rootCause": "The pi_cluster stack artifact packaged carrier-level preview STLs instead of the printable carrier plates rendered from pi_carrier.scad with stack mounts enabled, so the carriers directory lacked the expected stack-ready carrier file and only contained preview meshes.",
  "resolution": "Render carrier stack-mount plates directly from pi_carrier.scad, keep preview-only carrier_level exports in the preview folder, and update artifact packaging/doc references so the stack bundle ships the printable carriers in carriers/ alongside existing posts and preview outputs.",
