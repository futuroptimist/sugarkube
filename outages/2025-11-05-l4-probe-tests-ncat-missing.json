  "rootCause": "L4 probe tests were skipped in CI because the ncat (netcat) binary was not installed in the GitHub Actions runner environment. The l4_probe.sh script uses ncat for TCP port connectivity checks, and tests conditionally skip when ncat is unavailable.",
  "resolution": "Added ncat to the package installation list in .github/workflows/ci.yml. The tests use conditional skip logic that automatically enables them when ncat becomes available, so no test file changes were required.",
