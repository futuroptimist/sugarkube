  "rootCause": "mdns_helpers.py wrote its diagnostic messages with timestamps but emitted the successful hostname to stdout without any prefix. When the discovery flow surfaced that line to operators it appeared timestamp-less, making it difficult to correlate with surrounding log output.",
  "resolution": "Introduce a reusable timestamped logging helper that covers both stderr diagnostics and stdout results so every emitted line carries a timestamp. Update k3s-discover.sh to strip the timestamp before consuming the hostname.",
