  "rootCause": "Python 3.13+ changed behavior for scripts read from stdin (python3 -) to no longer automatically include the current directory in sys.path, as part of PEP 722 security improvements. The inline Python script in run_avahi_query() attempted to compensate by manually adding SCRIPT_DIR to sys.path at runtime, but this approach proved fragile and insufficient in Python 3.14. The import failures for k3s_mdns_query module occurred silently, causing tests in test_mdns_discovery_parsing.py to fail with empty results because no mDNS query results were returned.",
  "resolution": "Changed to use PYTHONPATH environment variable instead of runtime sys.path manipulation. Set PYTHONPATH=\"${SCRIPT_DIR}:${PYTHONPATH:-}\" before calling python3, which is the recommended approach for ensuring module import paths are available to Python scripts. This is more reliable across Python versions and follows Python best practices for module path management.",
