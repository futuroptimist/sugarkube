  "rootCause": "Documentation in notes/ci-test-failures-remaining-work.md and notes/skipped-tests-status.md showed outdated test count of 38/41 passing BATS tests (92.7%), when actual count was 40/41 passing (97.6%). The discrepancy occurred because l4_probe tests 16-17 were enabled in PR #4 (2025-11-05) when ncat was added to CI, but subsequent PRs (#5-#8) did not update the test count in documentation. This created confusion about actual CI status and could mislead future investigators.",
  "resolution": "Updated all references to test counts in notes/ files to reflect accurate current state: 40/41 BATS tests passing (97.6% pass rate), 3 skipped (discover_flow k3s integration tests 6-8), 0 failing. Corrected test count history to show 40 passing since PR #4. Verified CI workflow has all required dependencies (ncat at line 38, libglib2.0-bin at line 36 of .github/workflows/ci.yml). Documentation now accurately reflects that l4_probe tests 16-17 pass when ncat is available, which is standard in CI environment.",
