  "rootCause": "Log messages embedded the \"[k3s-discover mdns]\" prefix manually, so future updates risked emitting lines without timestamps or with duplicated prefixes. Some diagnostics already bypassed the helper, leading to inconsistent formatting in the self-check output.",
  "resolution": "Centralised logging through the mdns_helpers logger so every message receives the timestamp and prefix automatically, ensuring consistent formatting across all code paths.",
