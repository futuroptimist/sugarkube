# Power Ring Board Specifications

This document outlines the intended features for the Sugarkube power distribution board.  The design may evolve as the project grows.

## Connectors

- **Input:** one pair of screw terminals for 12 V supply
- **Outputs:** four 2‑pin JST‑VH connectors for branch wiring
- **Mounting holes:** four M3 holes placed on a 40 × 40 mm square

## Protection

- 10 A mini blade fuse on the input
- Optional 5 A fuses on each output (footprints included but unpopulated)

## Extras

- Test points for measuring battery voltage
- Silkscreen labels for polarity and connector numbers
- Title block comments record decoupling guidelines and export checks

These requirements are a starting point – modify the KiCad project as needed and update this file when the schematic changes.
