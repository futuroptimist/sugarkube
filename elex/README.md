# Electronics Schematics

The `elex` folder collects KiCad and Fritzing designs used throughout the Sugarkube project.  Schematics describe the power distribution ring and related circuits.

- `power_ring/` – KiCad project for a small distribution board.  See its README and `power_ring/specs.md` for details.
- `fritzing_sketch/` – placeholder for simplified wiring diagrams (coming soon).

Contributions welcome: edit the KiCad project with KiCad 7 or newer and export updated artifacts using `scripts/kicad_export.sh`.
